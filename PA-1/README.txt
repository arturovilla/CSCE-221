No online resources where used.
Instead of writing a whole new test file for the jeans class just to test the same functions I modified the collection test file to test both types of classes
The make file for the compilation is included along with all the files needed
This program runs the in the same way as PA-2 did except now the collection class is templated and works with other objects that have a color and size
4. (15 points) Write about the generic programming using templates based on this assignment Part 3. 
	Generic programing in this assignment is really useful because now that I have templated the class I can now make any number of  ADTs with a specific color and size attribute and have the same functions work with those classes. In general however, io fell like generic programming is useful because it prevents you from having to write the same code several times for similar classes. Using this assignments as an example, I could have made a class called shipping crates and instead of color I could have named that attribute something like destination and kept size the same. The collection function would still work with little to no modification. The template functionality is really useful when used by multiple classes that have similar attributes.
